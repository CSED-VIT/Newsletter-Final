        <h4><a href="https://www.partypoker.com/how-to-play/texas-holdem.html">How To Play</a></h4>
        <br>
        <p>
You could play poker, either live or online. Online poker in India is a booming industry. It's not illegal, as poker is considered by the Indian justice court to be a game of skill and not gambling. You can safely deposit and play on these websites:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.thespartanpoker.com">Spartan Poker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.adda52.com">Adda52 Poker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.pokerninja.net">Poker Ninja</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.starpoker.in">Star Poker</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.ftrpoker.com">FTR Poker</a></li>
</ul>
I would recommend studying a bit of poker strategy and watching some training videos on YouTube and starting at lower stakes and playing low buy-in tournaments. There are huge tournaments on many of these sites. <br>Spartan Poker has a “The Millionaire” tournament once a month which costs you 5500 rupees in buy-in which has a first place guaranteed prize amount of 20 lakhs and a second place prize guaranteed of 10 lakhs.<br> Poker Ninja has a tournament every week called “The Dragons Den” which has a prize pool guaranteed of 5 lakhs with a buy-in of 5500 and a tournament daily called “The Vampire Slayer” with a buy-in of 1650 and a guaranteed prize pool of 1 lakh rupees. </p>
        <p>Online poker is very exciting but one has to be very patient and pick his spots. There are many variants to Texas Hold’Em Poker, the most famous being the action-heavy Pot Limit Omaha. In Pot Limit Omaha(PLO), everyone gets dealt 4 cards and the format is same as Texas Hold’Em but at showdown, you have to use 2 of your 4 cards and 3 of the community cards.</p>
        <p>There are many live tournaments in Goa. There is a yearly event in the Deltin casino in Goa, called the Deltin Poker Tour for the live players with buy-ins ranging from 1000 rupees to 1 lakh rupees. 
        Poker is a mental sport which is rising slowly and would one day, hopefully and eventually become a sport played by youngsters everywhere. In India, the poker craze is catching on, of late. Playing poker helps in increasing mental strength, takes a lot of patience and effort and studying. </p>
        <p>The best live players in the world are Phil Ivey, Daniel Negreanu,</p>
        <p> The Moneymaker Effect was the poker boom in America in 2003 after the 2003 World Series of Poker Main Event. Chris Moneymaker, a 27-year old accountant had won an 86$ buy-in event online on Pokerstars which got him a ticket for the 10,000$ buy-in main event. He outlasted a field of 838 other players and won 2.5 million dollars. He made 2.5 million dollars from just 86$. This attracted a lot of players to the game and it was in its peak during that time in America. </p>
        <p>Due to The Moneymaker Effect, there have been many stories where people have made millions of dollars from 50$ online. <a href="https://www.highstakesdb.com/profiles/pokerstars/Isildur1.aspx">Viktor “Isildur1” Blom</a>, the most famous online player ever had started playing online with 50$ and he ran it up to 2 million dollars. He had major swings everyday and he had participated in the largest pot online ever against the Finnish pro Patrik Antonius, which was a pot of 1.3 million dollars. There are many players online who have enjoyed success and had dropped out of colleges to play poker as a pro. Charlie “Epiphany77” Carrel started with 50 pounds and has made millions of dollars playing online now. Isaac “philivey2694” Haxton had dropped out of Brown University to play poker and has made millions of dollars.  The greatest 6-max No Limit Hold’Em player in online poker now is <a href="https://www.highstakesdb.com/profiles/pokerstars/Sauce123.aspx">Ben “Sauce123” Sulsky</a>. The greatest all-round online poker now is <a href="https://www.highstakesdb.com/profiles/pokerstars/Trueteller.asp">xTimofey “Trueteller” Kuznetsov</a>. The best Pot Limit Omaha online player is <a href="https://www.highstakesdb.com/profiles/pokerstars/Jeans89.aspx">Jens “Jeans89” Kyllonnen</a>. There is a player called Randy “Nananoko” Lew who multi-tables 22 tables simultaneously.   </p>
        <p>You can watch the movie “Rounders” which is based on poker starring Matt Damon. I’ve included the links for player profiles which make for good reading and some videos and documentaries of online poker players. </p>

        <h2>How Do Poker Rooms Make Money?</h2>

        <p>Most casino-style games pit the player against the house. When this occurs, the house makes a profit by keeping all the money that isn’t paid back as part of a win. Poker rooms would seem to work differently, however, as players are competing with one another instead of the house.</p>

        <p>So how do poker rooms make money? That’s what this article is designed to uncover, so the next time you walk into a poker room or log-in online, you’ll know just where your money is going.</p>
        <h4>What Is a Poker Room?</h4>

        <p>This should be obvious, but I’ll go ahead and explain it for novices. A poker room is a place dedicated to the game of poker, whether it’s an online casino, brick-and-mortar establishment, or an underground gathering. In the case of casinos, anyone can enter and play. Underground establishments, on the other hand, require you to know a password to gain entry.</p>
        <h4>How Poker Rooms Make Money</h4>

        <p>The following are the most common ways that poker rooms make money. Rates will vary, of course, so don’t be shy about searching for the best deals. If everything else is equal, you should always go with the option that drains the least amount of your bankroll.</p>

        <p><b>The Rake</b> – This is the most common way for poker rooms to make a profit. An amount will be deducted from each pot and given to the poker room. Sometimes this will be a flat rate per pot, although the most common option is to charge a small percentage. In the latter case, the poker room will benefit more from larger pots, and it’s not unusual for underground games to bring in a ringer to keep the pots as large as possible.</p>

        <p><b>Time Drop</b> – This method charges the players a flat fee for the right to sit at the table. This is normally done when a new dealer enters the game, although it can also be charged at specific intervals (every half hour, for example). The amount may be as low as $3 per player, unless it happens to be a poker room for high rollers.</p>

        <p><b>Cover Charge</b> – In order to enter the poker room, the player must pay a fee. This method is becoming less common.</p>

        <p><b>Tournament Fees</b> – When a poker room holds a tournament, it will charge an entry fee and take a certain percentage of that money for the house. In the case of major tournaments, a poker room can also supplement their profits by charging merchandise vendors, television networks, and even the folks who are there to promote their products.</p>

        <p>While knowing how poker rooms make money won’t lead to a winning streak, it’s helpful to know as much about the game as possible. Not only will you be able to converse intelligently with other players, but you’ll also be able to look for poker rooms that take in less of a rake or charge a lower admission fee. The more money you can save, the more cash you’ll have to wager at the tables.</p>

        <h3>Important Starting Concepts</h3>

        <p> <b>   You Suck...but so did everyone. </b>So maybe you do OK in your home game, or maybe you once won a freeroll, but I will lay 100-1 odds that you are actually terrible at poker. Yeah, there is an outside chance you're just a poker genius, but in all liklihood, you actually have no idea what you're doing and have simply gotten lucky so far. Right now, you just don't know what you don't know. Don't let your ego stop you from improving and don't be a victim of the Dunning-Kruger effect. The rabbit hole of poker knowledge is so incredibly deep, that I could hardly believe it once I started studying.</p>

        <p><b> <a href="http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Number=5988672">List of terminology and abbreviations</a></b>. There are some terms that are not covered. If you come across something you don't know, just google it along with "poker" and you'll find something that will help.</p>

        <p><b>Fundamental Theory of Poker</b> Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it if you could see all your opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play your hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their cards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently from the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and every time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they could see all your cards, you lose. See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Theory-Poker-Professional-Player-Teaches/dp/1880685000/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1314114900&sr=1-1">Theory of Poker by David Slansky</a> for more.</p>

        <p>    <b>What Game to Play</b>. I would start in no limit (NL) cash games. Limit games are pretty boring IMO and pot limit omaha is a little too crazy for new players, but YMMV. Play the smallest stakes available until you are crushing it, then move up to the next stake level. Tournaments have way too much variance for a newbie IMO. Here is one redditor's thoughts.</p>

        <p><b>    Pot Odds.</b> The math of poker is pretty simply until you get much farther along with analyzing equity against hand ranges, and even then, a lot of players don't even bother with it. Here is a good start on pot odds. Here is another article which covers the rule of 2/4 which is about calculating the odds of hitting your outs.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/atb92/judging_by_many_of_the_posts_in_rpoker_lots_of/"><b>Variance.</b></a></p>

        <p><b>Bankroll Management.</b>Stolen from icanhazstax: Bankroll Management - While solid poker players have an edge against their opponents, and this edge allows these individuals to make money over the long run, the short term with regards to poker can be very unpredictable. These short-term swings are referred to as Variance (positive & negative variance). Due to variance, Bankroll Management is essential for anyone looking at poker from more than just an entertainment perspective. By following "rules" of proper BR management, and thus having enough buyins in your bankroll to stand the possible negative variance swings, one can assure the chances of them going 'busto' (losing their entire roll) is significantly decreased. While the number of suggested buyins can be debated, 'imo' the rule is something like: Cash = 20-30 buyins, STT = 40-50 buyins, MTT = 90+ buyins. See the anthologies for more.</p>

        <h3>Levels of Thinking:</h3>
        <br>
1st Level: Your cards
<br>
2nd Level: What does your opponent have
<br>
3rd Level: What does your opponent think you have
<br>
4th Level: What does your opponent think you think he has
<br>
5th level: What does your opponent think you think he thinks you have, etc.
<br>
At the micros, your opponents will almost all be level 1 thinkers. Don't get tricky; just play ABC poker.<br>

<br>
<b>Thought Processes.</b> Every time you make an action, you need to know:
<br>
    The reason for your action.
    <br>
    Why that actions beats the alternatives (check, fold, call, raise, shove, etc.)
    <br>
    What your plan is for subsequent events.
    <br>
    <h3>Books</h3>
    <br>
There are SO many good poker books out there. I have read a bunch, but that only represents a fraction of what's available. Here are what I think are super helpful books:
<br>
<b>Harrington on Hold 'Em 1 & 2</b>. They are about tournament play, which is very different from cash games, but learning his thought processes on hand reading and how to play certain hands is golden. His cash game books are great too.
    <br>
    <b> Professional No Limit Hold Em</b>. These guys are geniuses and will teach you SO much about playing poker.
    <br>
    <b>Theory of Poker.</b> Pretty much an essential read.
    <br>
    <b>Elements of Poker.</b> Great read
    <br>
    <b>Kill Everyone.</b> Great book on tournament poker.
        <br>

        <br>
Hopefully, this article plays a role in making you guys consider poker as a mental sport of skill and not just luck and/or gambling. Play responsibly. :)
