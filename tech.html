		<h2>Didi Chuxing Funding Rounds.</h2> 
        <h5 style="text-align: right;">by Archit</h5>

	</div><!-- .post-title -->

	<div class="post-content">

        <p>	Ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing, often touted to be China’s Uber, has raised more than $5.5 billion(I know!!) from investors in China, making it the largest amount of funding earned by a technology company ever in the country. Didi is the same company in which Apple invested in last year.It is believed to use its new funding to expand beyond China, invest in artificial intelligence initiatives, and even look into various driverless and automated vehicle technologies.</p>

        <p>Didi even drove Uber Technologies Inc. out of China last year, is already one of the country’s best-funded private companies.People familiar with the investments suggested the likes of SoftBank Group, China Merchants Bank Co. and one arm of Bank of Communications Co. were all backing Didi. The company's total valuation is said to have been raised from $34 billion to $50 billion.</p>

        <p>	This funding places Didi ahead of Xiaomi’s(China’s Apple) $46 billion valuation, and makes the company the world's second most valuable startup after Uber's $68 billion.Didi's expansion beyond hailing cars is believed to become "increasingly important," due to China's increasingly strict regulations regarding qualifications for the users who drive Didi vehicles. In places like Beijing and Shanghai, the company's drivers are required to be local residents, preventing what is estimated to be thousands of potential Didi Chuxing drivers from nearby towns and countryside to work for the startup.</p>

        <p>	Having cornered the market for on-demand cars and taxis, Cheng Wei, CEO of Didi, is branching out into bus services and bikes, throwing his weight for instance behind one of the country’s largest bicycle-renting services, Ofo. On the global front, the company has formed an alliance with Grab in Southeast Asia and Ola in India, to crush Uber in those regions.</p>
          
        <p>          We don't know that what did Uber do to Didi Chuxing but it is for sure taking it’s revenge in the Asian market.</p>
