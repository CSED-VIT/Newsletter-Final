Hi,
I hope you all are having sleepless nights, engineering  withdrawal symptoms. Its that time of the year I skip in my calendar.
But yeah to begin with we have conducted an event called ideathon, which we all as a club worked together on and could call our own.
I always wanted each member of this organisation to network among each other, but it was hard as all of you already have friends and saw SHEILD as just a place of work.
One thing I saw on the day of the event which I felt was as an achievement for me to see each member coordinate with people, stay calm in a confused state, did everything to make the event a success. More than this I saw ownership towards the club in each of you.
<br>
<br>
If we all are able to work together like this we can do wonders with the club.
We have shortlisted about twelve ideas from the event on which the startups department will be working on; to check the feasibility and how to go about them, you guys will be kept up to date with all that information.
<br>
<br>
I want each of you to work on the tasks given by your VP’s. Don’t think of it as a job that you need to complete cause you are being forced to, we do not gain anything out of it. You gain knowledge which helps you in becoming an entrepreneur. 
Apart from all that try keeping yourself up to date with the advancements in technology, world news, sports, fashion, music, etc.  A person with knowledge is always looked upon and respected.
<br><br>
Next semester we will be working on leadership development and make it a major aspect.
If you do not relate to the things above please sit down and think of the purpose you joined this club.
Apply for the organising committee each of you, even if you don’t get it, filling out the application would be an experience to assess yourself. 
Ending this saying best of luck for the rest of your exams and happy holidays.

This department has been working it’s off for a long time and is very deserving of its title. The perfect definition of a team,all the members stand united in all the work they deliver hence the success. The team was very successful in planning and designing a nouvelle event to the club, ‘IDEATHON’. This was accomplished only because the diligent working  nature of every single member who took it upon themselves to complete each and every task assigned on time as assigned by their leader. Even with the workload they had, the team did each part of their work with a lot of enthusiasm and SHEILD respects them for that. We expect the same amount, if not more dedication and diligence in all the forthcoming events hosted by the club. KUDOS TO EACH AND EVERY MEMBER.

Nobody can steal this title from this young man not only because he’s the perfect fit for his position but also because he’s the only one works in the department! That’s right! He’s the backbone of our finances and is hopefully not embezzling hehe. No matter how much pressure he’s under, owing to the multiple clubs he’s part of, he always has a smile on his face and is very approachable. Probably why he’s got the ladies weak at their knees xP

I believe SHEILD is a club like none other. It’s an organisation which focuses a lot on member Development, has a very systematic way of working and also helps you build confidence and to trust in your abilities to achieve whatever you want. All while focusing a lot on inculcating the skills required to be an entrepreneur in you guys.
I expect all of you to feel a sense of ownership towards the club and always look forward to learning new things and benefit as much as you can from SHEILD.
I myself was clueless about how to work when I first joined the organization. I saw most of my peers getting recognized by seniors for their work and kind of felt unnoticed. However, all that changed when I got into the events team and all my inputs really started to matter and my whole journey has been with a crazy amount of ups and downs which has taught me most of the things I feel I know about management. Also, it has created a liking towards entrepreneurship in me.
At the end of the day my aim for SHEILD is to be a platform which startups can approach if they are looking for any sort of help.
