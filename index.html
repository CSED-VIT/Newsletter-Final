                     <h3>Nitya</h3>
                     This month’s edition is going to be very different as you guys must have noticed, that is there is no member of the month. The newsletter is a late by a month this time which I am sorry about, due to the work on the blog. For Gravitas’17 we have conducted two successful events for which this entire team as worked as a whole with coordination. I am very happy to see each of you grow through this journey and I think everyone deserves appreciation in making the event a success and the amount of background work that was put in by each of you.<br><br>
                     Its time when you all realise soon the board will be passed on to the core, I want each of you take it seriously because being on the board is just not a position for namesake. It requires extreme amount of dedication, time and sacrifice. You should really love what you are doing to manage a position and have a vision. I’ve seen each of you learn a lot through this journey and it makes me happy to see a lot of you excel in other clubs and chapters as well.
                     <br /><br />
                     Also acknowledging the fact of this semester ending, we have the next semester coming up with a lot of firsts again. We plan on conducting many new events, its going to be another journey with new things we will come across. Finally I’d like to end this by wishing all of you good luck for term ends.<br><br>

                               Behind every success story lies a mentor. Most of us have heard of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Marissa Mayer, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Hewlett and David Packard, but what we do not know is that all of them have had mentors who helped them achieve success.
                                 Everyone wants to do something in life, but more often than not, one cannot achieve one’s dreams by oneself. Sometimes, one may even feel dejected by a lack of success and cease to believe in oneself. That is the problem that a good mentor tries to address: the great chasm between expectation and reality.<br>
                               People who want to achieve something must know three things:
                               <li style="color:white!important">What they are capable of doing.</li>
                                <li style="color:white!important">What exactly they want to do.</li>
                                <li style="color:white!important">How they plan to do it.</li>
                               </p>
                           <p style="color:white!important">


                     <br>
                     <b>Most of who you are is assessed more by people than by you:</b> A good mentor always knows one’s mentee’s true capabilities. As for what you want to do and how you plan to do it, it all depends on you yourself.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     <b>It is the hand that sculpts, and the sculpture that appeals:</b>Mentors facilitate discovery of the self and help you develop your own style of leadership. One cannot overcome self-doubt without a mentor.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>All mentors are masters of the art of listening: </b>Good mentors do only one thing 99% of the time: they listen. They listen to what you have to say about yourself, your ideas and how you want to change the world. The other 1% of the time, they help you re-align and achieve that goal.
                               Today, as members of SHEILD (CSED), it is very important that each and every one of us learns to mentor. As members of a club which deals exclusively with start-ups, people interested in start-ups and leadership development, it is imperative that all of us learn how to foster and nurture an enterprising mind. In Kick Startup, we, the members of this organization have the perfect opportunity to learn to be great mentors. Go out there, meet new people, learn from them, stay in touch with them, and guide them. In doing so, you will all have taken the first step to being great mentors.</p>

                           We, as an organisation have substantially grown into something which we all believe in, and want to work for in the past month. We have had a successful merger with CSED which is a major step towards building our brand in the college.
                           We have had 4 wonderful Saturday sessions which were filled with very informative and beautiful topics followed by discussions. We look forward to the members showing more enthusiasm towards this initiative from here on.
                           We have attained great pace and there's a momentum set currently in our organisation which should not go down anytime soon.
                           Everyone's increasing commitment towards their work shows ownership growing in the organisation.
                           We have our flagship events coming up. People, it's that time of the year when we can get closer to our vision.
                           We all will be working in synergy to pull off both our amazing events this Gravitas.

                        People are considered to be extremely lucky if they can earn a living by doing something they love and are passionate about. Some of them are actors, musicians, artists, athletes or just regular people who stumbled onto a video sharing website, uploaded videos of themselves doing stuff they’re good at, went viral and ended up pocketing enough to live a comfortable life. Think: YouTube and YouTubers. But is it really that straightforward? Just making videos and getting a good number of views on them don’t get you any money. So how exactly do YouTubers earn money? <br><br>
                        YouTubers can earn money in three ways - advertisements, merchandise and through sponsored content.  <br><br>
                        Revenue from advertisements is the main source of income for most YouTubers. Due to the impact of social media, almost all companies have their ads doing rounds before and in-between videos on YouTube. In order to have ads in their videos, YouTubers must monetize their channels, that is, they must have an approved Google AdSense account linked to their channel. Monetization of accounts allows companies to place their ads in and around videos, making these ads visible to viewers accessing YouTube. For every thousand views on the ad, advertising companies offer a certain amount of money, of which 45% is taken by YouTube and the remaining 55% is pocketed by the owner of the channel. The ad rate is around $3 to $5 for every thousand views on the ad. <br><br>
                        But simply getting views on a video does not guarantee that the viewers watched the ad or clicked on it. What if they skipped the ad? Therefore, the ad rate is valid only when a viewer watches either half of the ad or thirty seconds of it, whichever is earlier. So say a video got one million views, but none of the viewers watched the ads in the video, then the YouTuber will earn nothing from that video. All in all, revenue depends on the activity of the viewers and hence channels with a large number of subscribers and viewers are likely to earn more money through advertisements as compared to smaller channels. In 2016, famous Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie made around $10 million from ad revenue. <br><br>
                        Several YouTubers have their own merchandise doing rounds in the markets. Logan Paul and Jake Paul, both popular YouTubers, have their own lines of hoodies, t-shirts, mugs, caps and other goodies that are bought by their huge fan followings.
                        But, not all subscribers of a channel purchase merchandise. In fact, only about 0.005% to 3% of the average YouTuber’s audience goes ahead and buys merchandise. So to make merchandising cost effective, one must have an insanely large audience to sell to. For small or upcoming channels, merchandising is not feasible as a source of income, whereas for popular YouTubers, it can yield even more money than what they earn from advertisements. <br><br>
                        The third way for YouTubers to earn money is through sponsored content. YouTubers are paid by companies to make videos discussing various products and services offered by the companies. <br><br>
                        The amount that companies shell out for such paid product placements depends on the size of the YouTube channel, the demographic and view count. Big channels with north of a million subscribers are paid several thousands of dollars for a specific sponsorship as compared to lesser amounts for channels with fifty thousand to a hundred thousand subscribers. This contrast in pay is due to the significant difference in the number of views a video on a big channel and a small channel will garner.  <br><br>
                        Sponsored videos can be of many types – un-boxings, product reviews, or can be subtle mentions of products in videos. For example, Humorously Yours, a web series by TVF endorsed OnePlus devices all throughout the series. <br><br>
                        For a YouTuber with a huge and dedicated fan following, advertisements, merchandising and sponsored content can fetch them a lot of money. PewDiePie, who has the highest number of subscribers on YouTube with fifty seven million, is also the highest earning YouTuber as he pocketed $15 million in 2016. Roman Atwood and Lily Singh occupy the second and third positions with their earnings being $8 million and $7.5 million respectively.
                        Being a YouTuber has it’s benefits, after all! <br><br>

                       The launch of Reliance jio service has made the ground under the feet of its competitor’s tremble.
                       Although suffering from a much delayed launch, jio is serving its purpose well; giving free unlimited data, voice calls and messaging services till
                       January 2017. Yet how can a businessman like Mukesh Ambani who should be conscious about profit became so liberal with free services?
                       <br /><br />
                       The catch here which most people are unable to see is that reliance only wants to make a stable customer base before they have
                       their commercial roll out. Jio is compatible only with cellphones that support 4G and/or
                       LTE (Long Term Evolution.) Only 5% of the total users in India have 4G enabled cellphones. This makes it easy for reliance to
                       provide free services to this very limited audience in order to capture the market.
                       <br /><br />
                       Reliance also wants to promote there LYF brand of cellphones. Up till last year everyone was still impressed with the speed delivered by 3G and therefore
                       didn’t generally go for 4G enabled devices which were a little more expensive. Now Reliance released 4G enabled LYF cellphones at a price close to Rs.3000.
                       You can keep your old phone for regular use and buy LYF cellphones in order to use free voice calling or for data usage by creating hotspot. Therefore launch of
                       jio services also benefits their mobile segment.
                       <br /><br />
                       For jio users it is honeymoon period but, after 3 months the plans are not as cheap as they are now. Mathematically showing, Rs 50/GB data plan is available only
                       if you purchase their 4999 plan. The equation is 4999/75 = 67 Rs/ GB. That is profitable if your data usage is high as voice calls and message services are provided
                       free with this package. But in India 70-80 % of the users come in the category who use data between 0.8-2 GB and there’s no plan available which offers you data in this range.
                       <br /><br />
                       In 2002 when telecom industry was about to set foot in India and wireless telecommunication systems had started becoming popular, Reliance infocomm started with their initial offers
                       which were unheard of at that time. At a time when operators used to charge for incoming calls and premium handsets were priced at 15000, Reliance offered handsets at 10,000 with free
                       incoming calls and outgoing calls at 10p/sec. Customers were as excited as they are now but as soon as the services started, disappointment was looming around in the atmosphere of reliance users.
                       Though we hope for the best we can take all these free offers with a pinch of salt. Lets see who the ultimate beneficiaries are in the game of service providers.
                       <br /><br />
                       Launch of jio also proves to be useful for customers using services of other telecom operators. Since Reliance is quickly building its customer base and also taking up customers of their competitors,
                       it seems that other telecom providers are going on an all-out war and lowering their prices as much as possible. Airtel recently launched a data plan in which you have to pay Rs.1498
                       upfront and you can have 1 Gb data at 50 Rs. for whole year. Vodafone is also gearing up to drop prices for its postpaid users. Idea is expected to slash its rates up to 50%.These maybe the
                       rainy days for telecom operators but for customers it’s certainly the best spring they have seen till now.

                  </center>
                  <p class="add-bottom">
                     Going back about 30 years ago, entrepreneurship either meant owning a multi-million dollar company, or being a failure.
                     Today on the other hand is a very different scenario. With today’s ever increasing needs and skills, the word "entrepreneur" holds more meaning than ever before.
                     Today, all one needs is ambition, fuelled by passion to be an entrepreneur. Success, today, is subjective. Today, we have more options than ever before.
                     <br /><br />
                     But then comes the question of how one can become an entrepreneur. This question is something that everyone needs answers to, and the answers are never set in stone.
                    Non-Millennials do not know how modern entrepreneurship works, so looking for experienced opinion is a tad tough.
                    That is why I will try to answer that question based on the knowledge I’ve gathered from all the entrepreneurs I have studied:
                     <br /><br /></p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>One does not need capital to be successful: The thing about modern entrepreneurship is
                          that passion, ambition and determination is the most important investment one needs to make.
                          They create the foundations of a company, not capital. You may lose your team, you may not see growth in your idea for quite some time;
                           but if you are passionate and determined, then your ambition will come to fruition.</li>
                        <li>One almost never has anything to lose: A very important aspect of being an entrepreneur is to understand that if you believe in your idea, and you give it a 100%, then all you have to lose is time and effort you put into it. However, everyone knows that time and effort pay back in full - if not more - eventually. If you are ever afraid of what might happen when taking a risk, remember: people are friendly and they will support you if your idea appeals to them.</li>
                        <li>Things don’t fall in place; you make them fall in place: An entrepreneur must never sit back. People will almost never come to you - you must go to them. You can’t expect the world to know about your idea if you don’t put your idea out in the world. You can’t expect your idea to gain reputation if you don’t force your idea to. One must remember that as one grows, so does their company, and vice-versa. So, one must push oneself constantly to reach new heights.</li>
                        <li>Storytelling and branding: Your idea must appeal to the public. Whatever target audience you choose your product for must feel the need for your product. To make them feel the need for your product, you need to give them a story. Framing your story for any product is eventually what your idea will stand for, and that is what makes your idea special – branded. If you wish to be unique, turn your company into a brand.</li>
                        <li>Don’t overdo: There is something called “Imposter Syndrome” wherein you may think you aren’t as good as some other companies with similar ideas. Irrespective of whether that is the case, this thought will cause problems for you. Do not overwork at any point in time. Find a balance of satisfaction and progress, and that will help you to keep going at it.</li>
                     </ul>
                     <br><br>
                     <p class="add-bottom">I hope I have answered the questions any entrepreneur would have regarding how to begin and stay with your idea.
                       I would like to conclude my answer with one final note: if you ever find yourself in a problem you don’t have a solution to, remember to ask for help.
                        Help is always available.
